#### TO RUN APP

    1. Inside ARIndoorNav/server/ open up a console and run "node server.js" . Server is hosted on localhost:8080 (can be modified in the server file)
    2. Start Running app through simulator or connected device through .xcworkspace
    3. Need to link your server's IP address and the app's api links
        > Retrieve and save MAC Ip.Adress somewhere
        > Inside "ARIndoorNav.xcworkspace" > ARIndoorNav > Utils > Constants.swift
            > Replace IP adress underneath URLConstants with that of MAC Address
